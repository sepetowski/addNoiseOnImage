# Image Noise Generator

This C# program leverages the ASM library to apply various types of noise to images.
It allows users to upload an image and overlay one of three types of noise: salt and pepper, uniform, and Gaussian.
Users can also select the number of threads (1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64) for processing, select if they want to use asm or c# library for creating noise and download the generated image.
